# Library-Management-System
"Library Management System (MERN Stack)", designed to manage library operations such as book inventory, categorization, and transactions like borrowing and returning books. It follows the MERN architecture, which combines MongoDB for the database, Express.js and Node.js for the backend server, and likely React.js for the frontend interface (though the frontend files are not listed yet, they may exist in the full project structure).

At the root level, the project includes a README.md file, which typically provides an overview, installation guide, and instructions for running the application. There's also a LICENSE file detailing the usage terms. The bulk of the backend logic resides in the backend/ directory. This folder contains configuration files like .env.example for environment variables and .gitignore to exclude files from version control. The package.json and yarn.lock files manage dependencies and scripts for the Node.js backend.

The backend code appears to be modular, with a clear separation of concerns. The server.js file is likely the main entry point for the Express server. Within the models/ folder, there are Mongoose schemas such as Book.js, BookCategory.js, and BookTransaction.js, suggesting that the system supports detailed tracking of library resources, including book categories and user interactions with books (like borrowing or returning them).

Overall, this is a well-structured, full-stack web application built for managing a library system, demonstrating organized backend development and likely integration with a React frontend. If needed, I can also examine and summarize individual files for deeper insights.
